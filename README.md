# Laboratory of Computational Physics - Mod B

## Restricted Boltzmann machines as a Generative model for generic protein structure

### Context of this Project 

This project has been made by Giulio Albertin, Marco Dall'Ara and myself Joan Verguizas I Moliner in the context of a mid-term assigment for Laboratory of Computational Physics mod B with the supervision of professor Marco Baiesi. A first year course of the Physics of Data Masters held in the University of Padova.

### Data

The project has consisted in taking a set of data where each sample represents a linear chain of aminoacids that can be either polar or non-polar. Every single chain contains 5 aminoacids (that represents a proteine) and as a result forms an alternating polar and non-polar pattern of ACs.
